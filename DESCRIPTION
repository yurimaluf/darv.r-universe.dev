Title: Distribution of Algebra of Random Variables
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Maluf, Y. S.
Maintainer: <yurimaluf@gmail.com>
Description: The package offers numerical method to compute distributions yielded by algebra of random variables. Researchers often come across situations that the distribution of interrest involves expressions such as: X+Y, XY, X/Y, X/(X+Y) where X and Y might not be independent. Furthermore, the dependence structure is stem from serial correlation which typically occur in time series.
